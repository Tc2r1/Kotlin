# Jetpack Compose - Jetpack Compose Conversations!

This is the app for the [Jetpack Compose Tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial?authuser=1).

Here I've built a simple chat screen efficiently showing a list of expandable & animated messages containing an image and texts, designed using Material Design principles with a dark theme included and previewsâ€”all in under 100 lines of code!

## Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

Jetpack Compose is built around composable functions. These functions let you define your app's UI programmatically by describing how it should look and providing data dependencies, rather than focusing on the process of the UI's construction (initializing an element, attaching it to a parent, etc.). To create a composable function, just add the @Composable annotation to the function name.

## Tc2r1's Notes:

what I've learned so far:

    * Defining composable functions
    * Adding different elements in your composable
    * Structuring your UI component using layout composables
    * Extending composables by using modifiers
    * Creating an efficient list
    * Keeping track of state and modifying it
    * Adding user interaction on a composable
    * Animating messages while expanding them
