# Coroutines - Kotlin Coroutines App. 

This is the app for the [Android.com Developer's CodeLab for Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines).

## Coroutines

This starter app uses threads to increment the count a short delay after you press the screen. 
It will also fetch a new title from the network and display it on screen. 
In this CodeLab I will convert this application to use coroutines

This app demonstrates the following knowledge.
* The ability to Call code written with coroutines and obtain results.
* I will Use suspend functions to make async code sequential.
* I will Use launch and runBlocking to control how code executes.
* I will gain knowledge of techniques to convert existing APIs to coroutines using suspendCoroutine.
* I will Use coroutines with Architecture Components.
* I will show  best practices for testing coroutines.
